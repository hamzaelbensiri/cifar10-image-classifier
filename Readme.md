## Project Overview

This project documents the end-to-end process of building, training, and optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. Through a series of iterative experiments, we improved a baseline model's performance from **~60% to a final test accuracy of 86.39%**.

This repository showcases a professional machine learning workflow, including:
-   A robust, reproducible training pipeline with a validation set.
-   Techniques to combat overfitting like Data Augmentation, Dropout, and Weight Decay.
-   Advanced architectural components like Batch Normalization.
-   A sophisticated training loop with learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and best-model checkpointing.

## The Iterative Journey

Our development followed a structured, problem-solving approach:

1.  **Baseline Model:** We started with a simple CNN. It achieved ~60% accuracy but showed clear signs of overfitting.
2.  **Regularization:** We introduced Data Augmentation and Dropout to help the model generalize better. This stabilized training but hit a performance plateau, indicating the model lacked the capacity to learn more complex features.
3.  **Scaling the Architecture:** We designed a deeper, VGG-style network. This model struggled to train effectively, highlighting the need for better stabilization.
4.  **Final Optimized Model:** By adding **Batch Normalization** to the deep architecture, we enabled stable and efficient training, leading to our final high-performing result.

## Final Model Performance

The final model demonstrates a significant leap in performance, successfully learning to distinguish even between visually similar classes.

-   **Final Test Accuracy:** **86.39%**
-   **Best Validation Accuracy:** **86.20%**

### Training History
The training and validation loss curves show a healthy learning process, with the validation loss closely tracking the training loss, indicating that overfitting was successfully controlled.

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix highlights the model's strong performance. It is highly accurate with distinct classes like `automobile`, `ship`, and `truck`. While `cat` remains the most challenging class, its accuracy is vastly improved compared to earlier models.
